## Why LTV?

-  Your marketing team spends millions of dollars on various online campaigns to drive users to your website and signup new members
-  But is the marketing effort and spend worth it? To evaluate, you need to know the LTV of new members!
-  LTV is the forecasted value that new members will generate for your business over their lifetime
-  To be value added, LTV per member should substantially exceed your marketing cost per acquisition (CPA)
-  High growth online businesses achieve: **LTV > 3 x CPA**

##  Lifetime Value Predictor

* My new app calculates the predicted LTV of new member cohorts
* LTV is the sum of future cash flows projected forward on an exponentially declining basis, based on the historical performance of past cohorts
* The decay rates are different between members acquired organically versus those from marketing sources
  + Organic LTV (where i is years):
  
    \[\Large{LTV = \sum_{i=1}^{15}(ln(i) * -3.509 + Net Revenue_1}\]
  
  + Marketing LTV (where i is years):
  
    \[\Large{LTV = \sum_{i=1}^{15}(ln(i) * -1.009 + Net Revenue_1}\]
    
* These decay rates are built into the forecasting model and drive cash flow projections

## Example:  Marketing Signups


```r
# Let specify key inputs into the LTV model for Marketing Signups: 
type <- "Marketing"  #Type of Signup Cohort (i.e. Organic vs Marketing)
members <-  300000   #Number of members acquired in the quarter
netrev <- 442000     #Net Revenue generated by cohort in the quarter acquired
pct <- 43            #% of Net Revenues in the quarter acquired versus the first year
discount <- 16       #Discount rate % used to calculate the present value of future cashflows
```

* LTV = $20.73 per member for Marketing Signups
* On a present value basis, LTV = $10.54 per member.

LTV and PV of LTV:

```
## [1] 20.73405
```

```
## [1] 10.54099
```
